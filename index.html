          <summary><h3>STEEPLE Analysis</h3></summary>
          <p>
            The STEEPLE Analysis comes from a tool called the PEST analysis. 
            It was developed by Harvard Business Professor Francis J. Aguilar, 
            in his 1964 book Scanning the Business Environment. The main idea behind this process is 
            to get a general impression of the community where you will be evaluating public meetings. 
            We are using a version of the tool from management training firm Professional Academy, which 
            asks questions about the Social, Technical, Environmental, Economic, Political, Legal, and 
            Ethical characteristics of the local community. The letters have been rearranged to STEEPLE 
            so it is easier to remember and also organizes related concepts in a more logical order 
            (example: political next to legal).

        <h2>Meeting Evaluation</h2>
        <p>Our meeting evaluation tools will be based on the following findings by 
          Code for Asheville, <a href="https://adhoc.team/playbook-accessibility/" target="_blank">Accessibility Beyond Compliance</a>, as well as additional sources on usability: </p>
          <p>During the creation of this policy proposal, the following challenges with public 
            participation were identified:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The current public comment process requires a burdensome advance sign-up 
                process that requires disclosure of unnecessary personal information.</li>
                <li>Meeting materials do not contain a clear indication of updates or modifications 
                  to documents that were posted previously.</li>
                  <li>Local government entities lack data-driven metrics of public participation, such as 
                    the number of comments or the methods under which they were provided. As a result, it is 
                    challenging for staff, elected officials, or the public to analyze how changes to the public 
                    meeting process increase or decrease public participation.</li>
                    <li>Due to a lack of consistency in the process for public participation, it can be 
                      difficult to evaluate public support or opposition to measures considered by public bodies.</li>

              <h3>Meeting Evaluation Synthesis </h3>
               <p>This section contains a series of questions that tie together themes from evaluation of multiple 
                local meetings.</p>
                <p>Do meeting the agendas posted before the meeting clearly show what agenda items can and cannot be
                  commented on by the public? Are there any recommendations for improvement in how participation 
                  opportunities are shown?</p>
